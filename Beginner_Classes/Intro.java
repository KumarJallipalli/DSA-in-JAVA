         * WKT, switches has 2 states, ON & OFF.
         * Computers has billions of those switches called transistors. That means computer can only understand ON & OFF states of these switches. These are called 0 & 1 in simpler binary terms.
         * So, We need to give all the steps [instructions] which the computer needs to be performed in these combination of 1's & 0's.
         * The set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific task is called "Program"
         * As these set of instructions are given/written in combinations of 1's & 0's, This is termed as Machine language or Binary language

         * JAVA is a High Level, Object Oriented, Statistically/Loosely typed programming Language
         * Programming language is the language in whihc the programs are written.
         * 
         * Then, How does the computer understand this java language..?
         * Ans -> It doesn't. There will be a software called "Compiler" which translate the Java's HLL to binary language, which is understandable by computer.
         *      Compiler will also check the syntax errors. As these errors are found during compilation, theya re called "compilation errors"
